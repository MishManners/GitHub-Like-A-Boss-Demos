# GitHub Like a Boss #

Open repo for all things GitHub demos. The first demo will be held during Microsoft Build 2020. This will be a fun place for you all to come and engage with me and try out some of the new features - which have all been enabled on this repo.

Learn and share lots of tips and tricks, plus dig into the latest GitHub feature announcements.

This repo is often used to show off new features on [Mish's Twitch streams](https://twitch.tv/MishManners), or [GitHub's Open Source Friday streams](https://twitch.tv/GitHub). Follow both channels to stay up to date and jump in on the Discussions if you want to engage with us.

#### Talk abstract
